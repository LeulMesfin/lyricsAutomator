# lyricsAutomator
Designed and implemented a terminal-based app that displays the lyrics for a currently playing song on Spotify.
Interacted with the Spotify Web API to fetch the currently playing song on a user’s Spotify account. Then, I worked
with the Genius Web API to obtain the song’s lyrics web path from Genius: an online music encyclopedia. 
Finally, I used BeautifulSoup: an HTML parser, to scrape the lyrics from the path and displayed them on the user’s terminal.
